REST Controllers and Services
=============================
## Overview

In this assignment students are tasked with creating a small RESTful API that simulates a backend for a quiz-like application. Data will be stored in memory and NOT in a database. Students will implement the API from scratch without a skeleton.

### Summary of the API

Each `Quiz` is identified by a unique `name` field. Each `Quiz` contains a collection of `Question` elements. These questions are also uniquely identified by their own `question` field representing the text of the question. Each question contains a collection of `Answer` elements which are uniquely identified by their own `answer` field representing the text of the answer. The answer will also contain a field signifying if it is the correct answer for the question it belongs to.

This assignment is intentionally lacking in it's description of required services and entities/models. It is up to the student to decide how to model the requests, responses, and organize the business logic to meet the specified requirements.
