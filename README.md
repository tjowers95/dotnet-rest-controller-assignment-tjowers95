REST Controllers and Services
=============================
## Overview

In this assignment students are tasked with creating a small RESTful API that simulates a backend for a quiz-like application. Data will be stored in a postgreSQL database and Entity Framework Core will be used to interact with the database. A schema will need to be created either by utilizing the migrations/create-drop API provided by EF Core or by manually creating the schema and mapping the entities/models correctly. 

### Summary of the API
Each entity should be identified by a unique Id column which should be configured as the primary key for that entity.

Each `Quiz` should contain a `title` field. Each `Quiz` contains a collection of `Question` entities. `Questions` entities also contain a unique `text` field representing the text of the question. Each question contains a collection of `Answer` elements which contain a unique `text` field representing the text of the answer. The `Answer` entity will also contain a field signifying if it is the correct answer for the question it belongs to.

This assignment is intentionally lacking in it's description of required services and entities/models. It is up to the student to decide how to model the requests, responses, and organize the business logic to meet the specified requirements.
